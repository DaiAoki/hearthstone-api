# Hearthstone::Api
This is My favorite social card game 'Hearthstone' API client by pure Ruby with simple interface.
It covers all official endpoints. (Detail: [API Official Reference Page](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/api-reference/hearthstone-game-data-api))

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hearthstone-api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hearthstone-api

## Usage
Before coding, you have to get client_id(= `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` ) and client_secret(= `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` ) in [Official Page](https://develop.battle.net).

```
# initialize client
client = Hearthstone::Api.new(
  {
    client_id: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>,         # Required
    client_secret: <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>, # Required
    locale: "ja_JP",                     # Optionally, default: "en_US"
  }
)

# Card search
cards = client.search

# Fetch one card
card = client.fetch('52119-arch-villain-rafaam')

# Fetch deck
deck = client.deck("AAECAQcG+wyd8AKS+AKggAOblAPanQMMS6IE/web8wLR9QKD+wKe+wKz/AL1gAOXlAOalAOSnwMA")

# All metadata
metadata = client.metadata

# Specific metadata
sets = client.fetch_metadata("sets")
setGroups = client.fetch_metadata("setGroups")
types = client.fetch_metadata("types")
rarities = client.fetch_metadata("rarities")
classes = client.fetch_metadata("classes")
minionTypes = client.fetch_metadata("minionTypes")
keywords = client.fetch_metadata("keywords")
filterableFields = client.fetch_metadata("filterableFields")
numericFields = client.fetch_metadata("numericFields")
```

## Search Options
You can search by specifying conditions.
